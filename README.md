# About Planet XtaX 

Are you tired of Earth?  

When megacorps steal your dreams,  
and imprison them in a cold, dark database...  

It's time to build a new world

## Universe Construction Apparatus

Our civilization of XtaXians send this gift of a Universe Construction Apparatus to reward you for discovering blockchain.

How did it take you so long? Busy indulging your petty squabbles we think!

The important thing is you got there in the end. Now we present you with this apparatus for your people to use to build planets in the Evmos universe!

## Spacetime Fabric

### Space

![Universe Structure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ben-razor/planet-xtax-evm/main/assets/images/infographic/structure-simple-small-1.png)

Each blockchain forms a slice of space in the XZ plane.  

Different blockchains (or different contracts on the the same chain) can be added at different **Levels** in the Y plane.  

In future, wormholes will be used to transmit planets between **Levels** using IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) protocols.

There is no center and there are multiple centers. The center will change over time.

You must find your own center.

### Time

The structure of planets is determined by the planet schemas active during a time period.  

Schemas will be added and removed across time leading to varied structures throughout space.  

Planets created with short lasting schemas will have higher rarity.  

## Explorer

When a new planet is created it can be seached in the explorer.

Planets in the explorer act as outposts to allow instant travel between galaxies.

Clicking a planet takes you straight to that galaxy.

## Tools and Platforms

* Planet XtaX is designed to run on modern desktop web browsers
* In this version, MetaMask is needed to connect to Evmos
